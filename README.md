High Performance Hardware Implementation of AES using Minimal Resources

The increasing need for data protection in computer networks led to the development of several cryptographic algorithms hence sending data securely over a transmission link is critically important in many applications. Hardware implementation of cryptographic algorithms is physically secure than software implementations since outside attackers cannot modify them. In order to achieve higher performance in todayâ€™s heavily loaded communication networks, hardware implementation is a wise choice in terms of better speed and reliability.
